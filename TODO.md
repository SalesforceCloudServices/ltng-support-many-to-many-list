# Overview

**1. Support multiple ways to sort**

Currently, we are running the list of records back, but we don't specify the fields to use for sorting.

**2. Support explicitly setting the fields to use**

Products currently aren't supported in the Mobile Experience.

Even if we show the products not from the detail but by using the [lightning:recordForm](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning:recordForm/documentation) - it isn't supported.
